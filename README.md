# cmsc_16200_theatre_seating

The program should be run as follows:
name@linux:~$ python theatre_seating_problem.py file.name

File input should be formatted as follows:
The first line is the name of a friend, friend_A
The next several lines are the names of friends with the utility gained by friend_A in sitting next to this friend
Subsequent lines follow a similar pattern, look at the included txt files for examples

Note: This program will not recognize poorly formatted data (e.g. missing utilities, missing names)
